Instructions:

Problem Definition:

Create a lambda function in AWS that returns the current time as JSON data, such as: { "currentTime": "2050-01-24 15:06:26" }

Using IaC, define the infrastructure necessary to deploy and run the function in AWS.
```

## Notes

For the last 5 years I've been relying on the Serverless framework for IaC deployment needs. However, I understand that your platform team may prefer to use Terraform, so I decided to dust off my TF skills. I hope that they are still satisfactory!
